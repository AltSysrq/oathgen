Oathgen is written in C++11. In order to build oathgen, you must use a C++11
compiler. To build oathgen, simply run `make`; this will produce a binary
`oathgen` in the current directory. If your C++ compiler is not called `c++`,
you may need to set `CXX` and `CXXLD`; additionally, you may need to tweak
`CXXFLAGS` if your compiler doesn't understand `-std=c++11`. For example,
```
  make CXX=g++-4.x CXXLD=g++-4.x CXXFLAGS='-std=c++0x -I.'
```

Oathgen uses the Crypto++ library for hexadecimal and base32 decoding and
HMAC-SHA1 and SHA2. It includes its own implementation of the base32 encoder
since this is not present in the standard Crypto++ distribution.

Oathgen has been built and tested on i386, amd64, Sparc64 and 32-bit ARM.
