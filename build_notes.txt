Oathgen is written in C++11. In order to build oathgen, you must use a C++11
compiler. See the 'build.sh' script for the exact compiler options. Oathgen has
been built on g++, clang++ and MSVC++ compilers, but other C++11 compilers may
work too.

Oathgen uses the Crypto++ library for hexadecimal and base32 decoding and
HMAC-SHA1 and SHA2. It includes its own implementation of the base32 encoder
since this is not present in the standard Crypto++ distribution.

Oathgen has been built and tested on i386, amd64, Sparc64 and 32-bit ARM.
